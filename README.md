# Better Color Picker for Koikatsu!
Plugin that adds ability to pick color from anywhere on desktop in Koikatu character maker. The selected color is adjusted to look correct under the game's saturation filter by using the [ColorAdjuster](https://koikoi.happy.nu/#!plugin_color_adjuster.md) plugin.

## How to use
0. Get latest BepInEx.
1. Extract dll files to your BepInEx directory.
2. Start the main game and open character maker. The necessary [ColorAdjuster](https://koikoi.happy.nu/#!plugin_color_adjuster.md) plugin is included in the download, but you can check for an updated version.
3. Edit any color, enter the "Sliders" tab and click on the "Pick color from desktop" button.
4. Hover your mouse over the color you want to use and press any button to finish picking. Pressing shift is recommended.

**Note:** If the game window loses focus the capture stops. You can't Alt-Tab to a different window. Open the reference image next to the game instead. If you are running the game in full screen and have only 1 display, use the ImageLoader plugin to view a reference image inside character maker to pick the colors.

**Note 2:** If you are not using the saturation filter or just don't want to use the color adjustment function, go to plugin settings and disable the "Adjust color to saturation filter" setting.
